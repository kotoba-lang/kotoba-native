# The AVX2 availability guard, as bytes

A `kernel-dot-f32` emitter must not execute a single VEX-prefixed instruction
before this sequence has answered yes. This file is the sequence, resolved to
bytes, so the SIMD work can paste it rather than rediscover it.

It is written down separately from ADR 0038 (which owns the VEX encoders)
because the guard is not a VEX instruction and does not go through them: it is
four `cpuid` calls, one `xgetbv`, and integer tests.

## The check, and why it is four questions and not one

`cpuid` leaf 7 EBX bit 5 says the CPU implements AVX2. On its own that is not
enough to run one, and each of the other three questions closes a hole that
`cpuid` alone leaves open.

1. **Leaf 0, EAX >= 7.** `cpuid` with a leaf above the CPU's maximum does not
   fault; it returns the highest leaf's data instead. Reading leaf 7 on a CPU
   whose maximum is 6 therefore returns *some* EBX, and bit 5 of it means
   nothing. Ask leaf 0 first.
2. **Leaf 1, ECX bit 27 (OSXSAVE) and bit 28 (AVX).** Bit 28 is the CPU;
   bit 27 is the *operating system* — it reflects CR4.OSXSAVE, which the kernel
   sets when it is prepared to save and restore extended state. Both must be
   set, and bit 27 must be checked **before** step 3, because `xgetbv` itself
   raises `#UD` when CR4.OSXSAVE is clear. On K16 that is a self-inflicted
   fault in the middle of feature detection.
3. **`xgetbv` with ECX = 0, then XCR0 bits 1 and 2.** Bit 1 is the SSE state
   and bit 2 the AVX (upper YMM) state. The CPU can implement AVX2 and the OS
   can have enabled XSAVE while still declining to save the YMM upper halves;
   YMM registers are then not preserved across a context switch, and a kernel
   that uses them anyway computes wrong answers intermittently and only under
   load. `(eax & 6) == 6`.
4. **Leaf 7 subleaf 0, EBX bit 5.** AVX2 proper. The subleaf matters: leaf 7 is
   subleaf-dependent, and a leaf 7 query with whatever happened to be in ECX is
   a different question.

`vfmadd231ps` is **not** covered by any of the four. FMA is leaf 1 **ECX bit
12**, a separate feature that an AVX2 CPU is not required to have. An emitter
that uses FMA tests bit 12 as well, or falls back to `vmulps` + `vaddps`.

## The RBX problem

`cpuid` writes EAX, EBX, ECX and EDX unconditionally. RBX is callee-saved in
SysV, and nothing else in this backend touches it, so `emit-function`'s
prologue never saves it. `x86_64.cljc`'s `emit-kernel-cpuid` already carries
`push rbx` / `pop rbx` around its single `cpuid` for exactly this reason.

The sequence below saves RBX **once**, around all four `cpuid` calls, rather
than four times. Both exits pop it. It is stack-neutral as a whole, so nothing
downstream needs to account for it — but note that it is one push deep in the
middle, which matters if anything is ever inserted here that calls out (nothing
does, and nothing should).

## The bytes

71 bytes. Assembled and disassembled with LLVM 22.1.7,
`llvm-mc --triple=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu -filetype=obj` then
`llvm-objdump -d --x86-asm-syntax=intel`. Returns 1 in EAX when AVX2 is usable
and 0 otherwise; EAX is zero-extended because every write here is 32-bit.

As a flat vector, in the shape the canned blobs in `x86_64.cljc` already use:

```clojure
[0x53 0x31 0xc0 0x31 0xc9 0x0f 0xa2 0x83 0xf8 0x07 0x72 0x37 0xb8
 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x31 0xc9 0x0f 0xa2 0x81 0xe1 0x00 0x00 0x00
 0x18 0x81 0xf9 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x18 0x75 0x20 0x31 0xc9 0x0f 0x01
 0xd0 0x83 0xe0 0x06 0x83 0xf8 0x06 0x75 0x13 0xb8 0x07 0x00 0x00
 0x00 0x31 0xc9 0x0f 0xa2 0x89 0xd8 0xc1 0xe8 0x05 0x83 0xe0 0x01
 0x5b 0xc3 0x31 0xc0 0x5b 0xc3]
```

The two `jb`/`jne` displacements (0x37, 0x20, 0x13) are resolved for **this**
byte sequence and this one only. Inserting or removing an instruction changes
them. If the emitter needs to interleave anything, use
`layout/relative-branch` and a label rather than editing the displacements by
hand — the layout pass exists for this and the canned blobs above only get away
with fixed offsets because they are never edited.

## Preferring the operator over the blob

The `xgetbv` in this blob is also available as a Kotoba operator,
`kernel-xgetbv`, so the guard can be written as a `.kotoba` decision function
over `kernel-cpuid-*` and `kernel-xgetbv` instead of pasted as bytes. That is
the better shape — a decision expressed in Kotoba rather than in a blob is the
whole point of the K16 profile — and this file exists for the case where the
emitter needs the sequence inline, inside a primitive it is already emitting.

Whichever shape is used, `xgetbv` must not be reached with OSXSAVE clear.
Neither the operator nor the blob can enforce that; the ordering above is the
enforcement.

## What has not been verified

**Nothing here has been executed.** These bytes were assembled and
disassembled; that establishes that they are the instructions named, not that
the guard answers correctly on any CPU. This workstation is an Apple M4 and
Rosetta exposes no AVX, so the guard cannot even be given a machine to answer
about. Execution belongs to QEMU TCG `-cpu max` or to K16 on real hardware.
Until one of those has run, do not cite this file for anything except the
encodings.
