# ADR 0005: Introduce an explicit MC/layout boundary and defer ordinary `if` branches

**Status:** accepted and implemented; layout ownership extracted by ADR-0007
**Date:** 2026-08-08
**Scope:** x86-64 and AArch64 intra-function branches and variable-width rewriting

## Context

`kotoba-native` already lowers checked KIR directly to x86-64/AArch64 machine
bytes and writes ELF64. The missing middle is explicit machine data: register
choice, instruction selection, branch layout, encoding, and peephole rewriting
are still largely interleaved.

The visible consequence is the size-preserving peephole invariant. Branch
displacements are embedded before the optimizer can change code size, so a
shorter replacement must be padded back to its original width.

## Decision

Introduce `kotoba.native.layout` as the first MC/layout boundary. Its reference
EDN instruction tokens are maps with closed key sets:

```clojure
{:mir/op :mir/label
 :mir/id :kotoba.mir.label/if-end-1}

{:mir/op :mir/relative-branch
 :mir/encoding :x86-64/jz-rel32
 :mir/target :kotoba.mir.label/if-else-0}
```

The semantic model is Kotoba-defined. EDN is its human/developer reference
notation and Clojure/ClojureScript is its reference implementation; these maps
are data, not executable Clojure forms.

The reference EDN bytes are not content identity. `pr-str` and JSON output must
not be hashed as IR identity. Once this machine IR participates in the content
graph, normalize the abstract value and encode deterministic DAG-CBOR for CID
calculation. JSON is an interop projection. DAG-CBOR Links carry dependency
CIDs as graph edges rather than strings.

Keep the identities distinct:

- SourceCID identifies pinned source/module bytes;
- DefCID identifies normalized checked KIR semantics, including type, effects,
  capabilities, and dependency DefCIDs;
- BuildCID identifies compiler, target, flags, and build dependencies;
- ArtifactCID identifies the emitted Wasm/native artifact and descriptor.

This native repository does not take ownership of the KIR DAG-CBOR codec. The
existing `kotoba-lang` language contract remains the single DefCID authority;
`kotoba-kir` owns the checked IR model without defining a competing identity.
`artifact` owns source, build, and target-artifact identity.

Layout has two passes:

1. reserve each instruction's declared width and assign offsets to zero-width
   labels;
2. resolve each relative branch as
   `target - (instruction-position + instruction-size)` and require the encoder
   to produce exactly the reserved width.

The contract rejects duplicate labels, unresolved targets, unsupported
encodings, unqualified label IDs, extra keys, unknown widths, and encoder width
drift.

Migrate ordinary x86-64 and AArch64 `if` lowering first, then every audited
intra-function branch family. x86 uses next-instruction-relative `rel8`/`rel32`;
AArch64 uses the branch instruction's own address and requires four-byte-aligned
`imm14`/`imm19`/`imm26`. Nested branches share one function-local deterministic
label counter.

The in-repository pilot satisfied the extraction gate. `kotoba-gmir` now owns
the target-independent closed contract and `kotoba-mir` owns target selection,
explicit allocation state, and deterministic register allocation.
`kotoba-native` remains their first production consumer and owns KIR-to-GMIR
lowering, target instruction selection, byte encoding, and ELF emission.
`kotoba-codegen` owns the closed allocated MC program schema and final layout;
native validates at both selection and encoding boundaries through that shared
contract.

## Consequences

- x86-64 and AArch64 intra-function displacements are computed from final token
  sizes rather than from sizes embedded by expression emitters.
- Repeated compilation remains deterministic. The initial branch-token
  migration preserved artifact bytes; the later production GMIR/MIR slice
  intentionally emits smaller code for its admitted functions.
- Variant dispatch, kernel/string bounds, capability/fuel gates, division traps,
  and tail control flow now use label tokens. Calls remain final-pass relocation
  tokens rather than pre-laid bytes.
- Peephole NOP padding has been removed. Constant RHS rewrites shrink their
  windows and the layout pass recomputes downstream branches.
- `kotoba.native.machine-ir` now supplies a closed production slice with
  target-independent GMIR, target MIR, virtual registers, deterministic
  allocation, physical-register MC, and final byte encoding. Broader KIR
  coverage and spilling remain incremental work rather than implicit fallback
  inside this contract.

## Verification

The native layout and machine-IR tests fix the following properties:

- forward and backward signed displacements;
- displacement recomputation when an arm changes size;
- fail-closed canonical token validation;
- reserved-width enforcement;
- production tail-`if` encoding through both PC-relative bases;
- branch-heavy parity after variable-width constant rewrites.

The compiler's shared ISA harness separately executes the production slice in
real x86-64 and AArch64 processes.
