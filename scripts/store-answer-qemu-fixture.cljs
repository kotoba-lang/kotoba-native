;; storefix: boot a Kotoba kernel image that stores a word at every transfer
;; width and prints, for each, whether the store's ANSWER was the word it was
;; handed and whether a load back agrees.
;;
;; This repository does not run compiled programs, so its own suite is
;; encodings only -- `store_result_test.clj` says the bytes are the
;; instructions they are named for, and nothing there says the CPU agrees. This
;; does. It is a FIXTURE and not a test: it needs amu, QEMU and OVMF, none of
;; which this repo depends on, so it is run by hand and its result is quoted in
;; the ADR rather than gating a suite.

;;   nbb scripts/store-answer-qemu-fixture.cljs --amu <path-to-amu-worktree>
;;
;; `--expect X5X6X7X8` asks for the PRE-FIX console instead, which is how the
;; defect was shown to be real before it was fixed. Anything else is refused.
;;
;; It refuses rather than skipping when a tool is missing. A fixture that
;; prints "ok" because it could not find QEMU is the failure class this
;; workspace keeps finding: a check that could not run answering like a check
;; that ran and found nothing wrong.
