;; storefix: which aiueos objects read a bounded store's ANSWER, and which of
;; those let it decide something?
;;
;; The evidence behind the blast-radius table in
;; docs/adr/0051-a-bounded-store-answers-with-the-word-it-stored.md. It is an
;; AUDIT, not a gate: it takes the directory to read as an argument, it lives
;; outside this repository's tree, and nothing here runs it in CI. A check
;; whose input is not in the tree it is attached to cannot be green or red for
;; a reason anyone can act on -- see the `root-permit-index` note in the
;; superproject's CLAUDE.md.

;;
;; Every store is an expression, so "used in value position" cannot be read off
;; a grep. This propagates taint from each `kernel-store-*` / `slice-store-*`
;; node through `let` bindings AND `defn` return values -- the second is
;; required, because this codebase's stores are wrapped in `store32`/`store64`
;; helpers -- and then asks whether a tainted value reaches a comparison or an
;; `if` test rather than only a `(* 0 ...)` ordering idiom.
;;
;;   DECIDES     a store answer reaches `=`/`<`/`>`/`<=`/`>=` or an `if` test
;;   ORDER-ONLY  every use is under `(* 0 ...)`; only the data dependency
;;               survives, which is why sha256.o hashed correctly on the
;;               machine while the arena-shaped objects did not
;;
;; The taint is an over-approximation across `defn` boundaries: it does not
;; track which call site a return value flows to, so a helper whose answer is
;; zeroed at every call site still marks its file DECIDES. That is the honest
;; direction for a blast-radius list.
;;
;; A file it cannot read is reported and the run refuses with exit 2 -- neither
;; 0 nor 1 -- so "could not answer" cannot be read as "answered, and clean".
