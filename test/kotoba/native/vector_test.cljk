  "`vector-i64` / `vector-f64` on both native ISAs (ADR-2608030300).

  `kotoba-kir` has declared these operators since before either native backend
  existed and `kotoba-wasm` has implemented them all along; only native had
  nothing. What closed the gap is NOT a new value representation: a vector
  value is a one-word handle, the same width and the same discipline as the
  pair handle every option, result, string and keyword already travels as, so
  all six operations are ordinary context calls.

  These tests pin the three claims that make that lowering true rather than
  merely plausible: the host table offsets, that construction is linear rather
  than quadratic, and that the f64 family is the SAME lowering rather than a
  parallel one that could drift."
