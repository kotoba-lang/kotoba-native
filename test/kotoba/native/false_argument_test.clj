  "A call argument whose KIR form is the literal `false` must be emitted like
  any other argument.

  It was not. All three of this backend's argument walks -- the self tail call,
  the ordinary call, and the host context call -- were written as `(if-let [arg
  (first remaining)] …)`, and `if-let` tests the BOUND VALUE rather than the
  sequence. A `false` argument therefore took the else branch, so THAT argument
  AND EVERY ARGUMENT AFTER IT was never emitted, while the call still popped
  the full arity. The program assembled, was shorter by exactly the missing
  pushes, and then ran off its own stack.

  The assertions here are byte COUNTS rather than runtime results on purpose.
  A corrupted stack does not reliably fault -- a one-slot displacement often
  reads a plausible word and returns a plausible answer -- so a runtime-only
  test can pass by luck. The length of the emitted code cannot: a dropped
  argument is exactly the eleven bytes of `movabs rax,imm64` + `push rax` that
  did not get emitted, and eleven bytes is not a coincidence anything can
  produce. The `true` and `false` forms of one program differ only in the
  IMMEDIATE 1 vs 0, so their code must be the same length, and must differ in
  exactly as many bytes as there are flipped literals.

  Every row also runs on AArch64, where the same rows always passed: that
  backend walks arguments with `mapcat` and has no truthiness test to get
  wrong. Keeping the rows shared is what makes that an asserted property of
  the pair rather than a remark -- the defect was never about how a `:bool` is
  represented (both backends carry it as an i64 word), only about how one
  backend's loop was written."
