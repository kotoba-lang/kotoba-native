  "fuel64: the object replenish is a 64-bit budget written in one of two forms.

  What this file has to hold down is not that the wide form encodes -- an
  assembler agrees with that in one line -- but the three ways a widening like
  this silently goes wrong:

    1. Every existing object's bytes move, because the encoder was rewritten
       and the narrow path was rewritten with it. `every-shipped-objects-bytes`
       is a golden taken at the commit BEFORE the change, over all 108 entries
       the table had then.
    2. The line between the forms is drawn at 2^32 rather than 2^31, because
       `little-endian` at width 4 accepts unsigned values and the CPU
       sign-extends the immediate. That produces a NEGATIVE fuel word, which
       `cmp qword [r9+8],0` reads as `has fuel` and `dec` walks away from zero:
       the object never traps again. `the-line-is-signed` pins 2147483648 as
       the first wide value.
    3. The wide form is reachable only from a test. `aiueos-fuel-wide-probe`
       is in the production table, so the packager emits it on every build."

;; ── the budget the machine runs on is the budget somebody wrote ────────────
;;
;; A ceiling that can be raised and a budget that is silently discarded are the
;; same defect at two layers, and the second one shipped for longer. Until
;; 2026-09-03 `package-user` wrote the CONSTANT 512 into its context, so a
;; ring-3 image ran on 512 whatever `--fuel` said -- the flag is parsed,
;; validated, sealed into `:limits :fuel` and `:fuel-abi :initial`, and then
;; the one place that decides what the machine gets ignored all of it. The same
;; line was in amu's PE32+ packager, where the LOADER stream found it from the
;; other end: `sha256-region` costs 1,772 fuel per 64-byte block, so ONE block
;; could not fit in 512 and the loader's `integrity` module had never returned.
;;
;; The test is DIFFERENTIAL rather than positional. Reading the word at a fixed
;; offset would need a different offset per route and would go stale the moment
;; a context grows; two budgets that must not produce the same bytes needs no
;; offset at all, and is exactly the observation that found the defect --
;; `--fuel 512` and `--fuel 1048576` produced identical images.
;;
;; THE OBJECT ROUTE IS LISTED AS INSENSITIVE ON PURPOSE, not omitted. Its
;; `.data` really does hold 512 and really is independent of the sealed budget,
;; because the wrapper replenishes on every call and overwrites it before the
;; entry runs. Leaving it out would make this test read as "every packager is
;; fuel-sensitive", which is false; listing it with its reason means a future
;; edit that makes the object route sensitive has to come here and say why.
