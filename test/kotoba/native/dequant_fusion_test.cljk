  "dequant: the fused dequantize-and-dot family, as bytes.

  `kernel-dot-f32` folds two f32 regions. A transformer's weights are not f32,
  so using it means writing a dequantized row to memory and reading it back
  once -- four bytes per weight of traffic that exists only because the
  operation could not see the codes. These instructions remove it: the codes
  are widened INSIDE the register file and multiplied by the activations
  without ever becoming f32 in memory.

  What the tests here can and cannot say. They can say that the two arms are
  the byte sequences intended, that no VEX instruction runs before the guard
  answers, that every register the sequence writes and does not own is pushed
  and popped, and that the half-precision shortcut the machine takes is
  exactly the C's equation over all 65536 inputs. They cannot say the two arms
  compute the same number: that is a claim about a machine, and it is
  measured in `os/aiueos/scripts/smoke-qemu-dequant-dot.cljs`, which runs the
  same artifact under `-cpu max` and `-cpu qemu64` and compares the digits
  with kotoba-kir's answer.
