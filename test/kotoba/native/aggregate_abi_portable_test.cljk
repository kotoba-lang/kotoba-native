  "The six deftests of `kotoba.native.aggregate-abi-test` that never needed a
  JVM, plus the half of the seventh that did not.

  One assertion in that file genuinely needs the classpath:
  `(= abi/contract (-> \"aggregate-abi.edn\" io/resource slurp edn/read-string))`
  — the published EDN has to be compared against the file it is published as,
  and that needs the side which can still read the file. It stays there.

  Everything else was JVM-bound only by sharing a file with it, and the deftest
  that owned that assertion is called `published-edn-is-the-portable-contract`.
  It asserts the contract is portable, and it could only ever run on one host.
  The perturbations it applies — a dropped target, an ambient policy smuggled
  in, a case limit past the boundary, a missing extraction — are refusals
  `validate-contract!` owes on BOTH hosts, and they are here now.

  `aggregate-abi` carries no reader conditional and no bit arithmetic in 309
  lines, so the expected result is parity. Parity nobody has executed is an
  assumption."
