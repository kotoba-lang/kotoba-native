  "boot-lit: byte goldens for read-only literals and the two wider firmware
  calls.

  Every literal below was cross-checked with `llvm-mc` on 2026-09-02 -- the
  wide call's whole sequence was DISASSEMBLED and read back, not merely
  assembled and compared -- so a disagreement here is this encoder's rather
  than an assembler's opinion.

  What the pool assertions are really about is the difference between an
  OFFSET and an ADDRESS. `:x86-64/data-address` resolves to `mov reg, imm64`
  holding an offset from the start of the emitted buffer, and something else
  adds the base. Under firmware there is no something else."
