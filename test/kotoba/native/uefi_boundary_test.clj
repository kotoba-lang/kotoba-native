  "boot: byte goldens for the four UEFI firmware-boundary operations.

  Every literal below was cross-checked against `llvm-mc --show-encoding` on
  2026-09-02 before it was written down, so a disagreement here is this
  encoder's, not an assembler's opinion. The long one is `kernel-uefi-call2`,
  and what its goldens are really asserting is the register discipline rather
  than the instruction selection: three separate things have to hold at a
  Microsoft x64 call site and none of them holds on arrival."
