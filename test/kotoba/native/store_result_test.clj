(ns kotoba.native.store-result-test
  "storefix: a bounded store is an EXPRESSION, and its value is the word it
  stored.

  The KIR reference interpreter has always said so. `kotoba.kir`'s
  `kernel-store-*` arm is `(do (vswap! bytes assoc slot (word-byte-at operand
  0)) operand)` and its wider twin is `(do (write-word! operand) operand)`:
  both answer with the fourth argument, UNTRUNCATED, so `(kernel-store-u8 b l i
  300)` stores 44 and answers 300.

  The stack emitter in `kotoba.native.x86-64` agreed with it for free --
  `emit-kernel-store-u8` leaves the evaluated value in RAX and the store reads
  AL out of it -- and the oracle carries a comment saying exactly that. The
  machine-IR emitter, which is the one `emit-program` actually reaches, did
  not: it passed the STORED register to `x86-memory-access` as the access's
  register operand and never wrote `:mir/dst` at all. The destination register
  the allocator had reserved was therefore whatever it happened to hold.

  Measured on this repository at 8a8c510, `(kernel-store-u8 b l i v)`:

      49 89 c3     mov r11, rax          ; base
      49 01 d3     add r11, rdx          ; + index
      45 88 03     mov byte ptr [r11], r8b
      e9 ...       jmp done
      0f 0b        ud2
      48 89 f8     mov rax, rdi          ; <- the ANSWER: rdi, still the base

  and on AArch64 the same fixture answered with X5, which nothing in the
  function had ever written.

  Every assertion below is about ENCODINGS. This repository does not run
  compiled programs. The execution claim is made elsewhere and is a different
  claim: `scripts/store-answer-qemu-fixture.cljs` boots
  `test/fixtures/store-answer-qemu.kotoba` on a real x86-64 CPU under QEMU and
  reads the console it wrote.
