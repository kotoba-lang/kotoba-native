  "The toolchain-generated x86-64 interrupt entry, byte by byte.

  EVERY byte string below came from the system assembler, not from a hand
  carry. `clang -target x86_64-unknown-none` assembled the same sequence, and
  `llvm-objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text` produced a 112-byte `.text`
  that is byte-identical to `entry-bytes` for vector 3. The disassembly is in
  the ADR.

  NOT EXECUTED HERE. This repository does not run compiled programs, so a
  green suite is encodings only. The entry is executed under QEMU by the
  fixture in `test/kotoba/native/isr_qemu_fixture.cljs`, which is what stands
  in for execution -- and the two are different claims: this file says the
  bytes are the instructions they are named for, and that says they do what
  the instructions mean."
