  "Binary32 on both native ISAs (kotoba-lang ADR-kotoba-floating-point-on-native).

  These are BYTE goldens, not shape assertions. The whole risk in this change is
  emitting the double-precision instruction where the single-precision one was
  meant: `ADDSD` and `ADDSS` differ in one prefix byte (0xf2 vs 0xf3), `FADD D`
  and `FADD S` in one bit (22), and a program built from the wrong one still
  runs, still returns a number, and returns the wrong one. Nothing but the bytes
  catches that, so every case asserts the single-precision encoding is present
  AND that its double-precision twin is not.

  Every encoding here was assembled with clang -- `-target x86_64-apple-macos`
  and `-target arm64-apple-macos` -- and read back with `otool -t`, which is the
  standard both backends' own f64 blocks hold themselves to. It earned its keep:
  a first hand-derivation of `FADD S0,S0,S1` came out 0x1E202800, and the
  assembler says 0x1E212800.

  The representation being pinned: an f32 occupies one integer word holding its
  binary32 pattern SIGN-EXTENDED from bit 31. So `f32-to-bits` emits nothing,
  `f32-from-bits` emits the sign extension, and every operation whose result
  comes back out of the FP bank through a 32-bit destination re-extends -- since
  writing eax/w0 zeroes the upper half of the 64-bit register. Without that, the
  backend and the KIR oracle disagree on every negative float, because
  `f32-to-i64-bits` yields a SIGNED i32.

  Which register the result lands in is the ALLOCATOR's choice, not this
  change's, so the result-side assertions are structural: they check that a
  32-bit move out of the FP bank is immediately followed by a sign extension of
  the same register, whichever register that is. Pinning the allocator's current
  answer would make this file go red for a reason that has nothing to do with
  floating point."
