  "The i64 vector handle is spelled `:vector-i64` by every producer. This
  repository spelled it `:vector` in `word-result-type?`, and nothing emits
  that spelling, so a `:vector-i64` at any function boundary rejected the
  WHOLE module as `unsupported-function-module`.

  These tests are written to fail against the pre-fix backend. Restoring the
  `:vector` spelling makes `a-vector-i64-boundary-lowers-on-both-isas` reject
  the module again -- and the negative control below asserts the rejection
  arrives with `:problem :unsupported-function-module`, so a module that
  breaks for some other reason cannot be counted as this test discriminating."
