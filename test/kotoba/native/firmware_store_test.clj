  "fwstore: byte goldens for the allocation that answers with an address.

  Every literal below was read back from `llvm-mc -triple x86_64
  -show-encoding` rather than assembled from the intent. The three that matter
  most are the two `[rsp+0x20]` forms and the `cmovne`: a wrong ModRM in the
  first pair puts the out-word somewhere the callee owns, and a wrong
  condition in the third answers with the firmware's out-word on FAILURE --
  neither of which faults, and both of which produce a base a later window is
  declared over."
