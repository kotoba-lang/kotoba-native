(ns kotoba.native.peephole
  "Deterministic machine-level simplification shared by the native backends.

  Every intra-function branch is a `kotoba.native.layout` token now, so a
  rewrite may change instruction count: layout recomputes labels, relative
  displacements, function offsets, literal offsets, calls, and tail jumps only
  after the final token sizes are known. The former NOP-padding API has been
  removed; constant right operands now reclaim the spill/reload bytes.

  ## Why recognition is on KIR forms, not on emitted bytes

  A classic peephole matches byte patterns in the instruction stream. That is
  unsound here: the token vector is undelimited byte soup, so a 64-bit
  immediate whose bytes happen to spell a recognized opcode sequence would be
  rewritten as if it were code. `constant-operand` therefore inspects the KIR
  operand FORM -- which is unambiguous by construction -- and the backend
  builds the replacement window itself from encodings it already owns. No
  function here ever scans emitted bytes looking for instructions.

  ## Determinism

  Every function here is a pure function of its arguments with no map/set
  iteration order dependence, so the same KIR always yields the same bytes.
  That is what `kotoba-verifier` requires: it re-derives emission from sealed
  KIR and rejects any drift, so a nondeterministic pass would not merely be
  untidy, it would make every artifact unverifiable."

;; The i64 VALUE a KIR operand materializes at compile time, or nil when the
;; operand is anything else. Deliberately narrow: only the two forms whose
;; emitted code provably (a) needs no accumulator register, (b) reads no stack
;; slot, and therefore (c) is insensitive to the temp-depth the spill it
;; replaces would have introduced. Every other form -- a symbol (reads a
;; param/let slot at a depth-relative displacement), a call, a cap-call, a
;; nested expression -- fails (c), (b) or both, and must keep the spill.
;;
;; `integer?` alone does not reliably recognize a cljs `bigint`; mirrors the
;; identical dispatch guard both backends' own `emit-expr` already uses.
;; `false` must map to the value 0 and still be reported as present, so this
;; returns nil-or-value and callers test with `some?`, never truthiness.
