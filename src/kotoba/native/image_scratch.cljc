(ns kotoba.native.image-scratch
  "boot-scratch: the writable area an image packager reserves for its guest.

  A Kotoba UEFI application had no address it was allowed to write. Its literal
  pool sits at the end of `.text`, which the packager marks `0x60000020` --
  read and execute -- and `kernel-boot-info`/`kernel-system-table` answer with
  words the FIRMWARE handed over, not with the address of the context slot they
  were parked in. So every boot service that takes an out-pointer
  (`AllocatePages`, `HandleProtocol`, `GetMemoryMap`) was unreachable, and
  `OpenProtocol` was reachable only because `EFI_OPEN_PROTOCOL_TEST_PROTOCOL`
  makes the firmware ignore its `Interface` out-parameter.

  This namespace is the two numbers that fix it, stated ONCE where both the
  encoder and the packager read them -- the discipline
  `kotoba.native.interrupt-abi` established for the interrupt entry's stride
  and context slot.

  WHY IT IS UEFI-ONLY, and this is measured rather than chosen. The offset
  below is a displacement off the hidden context register, so the same four
  bytes mean something in every image that has a context. In the JVM kernel
  image they mean the GLOBAL DESCRIPTOR TABLE: `kotoba.native.elf64`'s
  `kernel-gdt-offset` is 96, the same 0x60, and the kernel context continues
  past it with the GDTR at 152 and the TSS at 168. A kernel that asked for
  scratch there would be handed its own segment descriptors. The operation is
  therefore gated to the UEFI target in amu rather than given a second
  displacement, because a second displacement is a second layout that both ELF
  twins would have to agree on byte for byte.")

;; The scratch area begins immediately after the hidden context. 96 is the
;; context's size under BOTH UEFI entry contracts -- the two-arity one parks
;; the ImageHandle at +0x50 and the SystemTable at +0x58, so the last addressed
;; byte is 95, and the zero-arity contract was given the same 96 rather than a
;; second layout.
;;
;; It is a disp8, which is why the encoding is four bytes rather than seven.
;; Raising it past 127 changes the instruction, so this fails closed below.
(def offset 0x60)

;; 16384 bytes.
;;
;; NOT one page. `kotoba.compiler.packaging.pe32plus/package-embedded-kernel`
;; has reserved exactly 16 KiB for a UEFI memory map since it was written, and
;; a memory map is the largest thing a boot path puts in scratch: under OVMF it
;; is on the order of 80 descriptors of 48 bytes.
;;
;; It is also the largest CHECKED-MEMORY window tier (`kernel-load-u64-16k`),
;; so the only spelling of a bounded access that can exceed the reservation is
;; the 64k tier -- which is precisely the case kotoba-sema's ceiling refuses.
;;
;; The same number lives in `kotoba.compiler.frontend/image-scratch-bytes`,
;; which is what ADMITS a window over the region, and amu's suite asserts the
;; two are equal: a frontend admitting a wider window than the packager
;; reserves admits a write past the section.
