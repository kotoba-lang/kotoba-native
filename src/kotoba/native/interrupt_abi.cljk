(ns kotoba.native.interrupt-abi
  "isr: the x86-64 interrupt entry a Kotoba body is called from.

  An interrupt is the one call into a kernel that nothing in the kernel makes.
  The CPU builds a frame, jumps to whatever address the IDT gate names, and
  from that instant the machine is in a state no compiled function's prologue
  is written for: no context register, no fuel, a direction flag that may be
  set, and fifteen general registers belonging to whatever was interrupted.
  This namespace is the fixed byte sequence that turns that into an ordinary
  four-argument SysV call and turns the return back into an `iretq`.

  It is TOOLCHAIN-GENERATED, which is the whole point. aiueos's
  `kernel/entry.S` writes this sequence by hand, once per vector, in assembly
  that is not Kotoba and is not emitted by anything -- and the K16 pure-native
  profile refuses a link that contains a handwritten object. A generated entry
  is admitted by that profile because it is reproducible: the same table and
  the same body offsets produce the same bytes.

  WHAT IT IS NOT. It contains no decisions. It does not read the error code to
  work out what happened, does not choose whether to acknowledge an interrupt
  controller, and does not act on what the body returns. Every one of those is
  a judgement, and a judgement belongs in the `.kotoba` body where it can be
  read, typed and verified -- the same boundary aiueos ADR-0015 draws around
  its C mechanism. The entry's job is to make the body callable and to leave
  the machine exactly as it found it.

  Two routes use this:

    IMAGE   `kotoba.native.elf64/package-kernel` lays one entry per vector in
            a reserved region of `.text` and records its base in the kernel
            context, so `kernel-isr-entry-address` can load it.
    OBJECT  `package-kernel-object` emits ONE entry as the object's public
            symbol, so a C IDT builder in the transitional image can install
            `kotoba_aiueos_isr_<vector>` directly. There is no entry table in
            an object -- objects cannot reference each other -- so
            `kernel-isr-entry-address` has no answer there and is refused."
  (:require [kotoba.lang.text :as str]))

;; ── the name ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
;;
;; An entry is named for its vector: `aiueos-isr-3` handles vector 3. The name
;; carries the number because the generated sequence has to know its own
;; vector -- it passes it to the body as the first argument -- and a mnemonic
;; table (`bp`, `pf`, ...) would be a second place to keep in sync across
;; kotoba-sema, this file and both packagers, kept equal only by review. A
;; decimal suffix is derivable in both directions with no table at all.
;;
;; kotoba-sema refuses `aiueos-isr-bp` at analysis, which is where a source
;; mistake should surface. This file repeats the rule because it also has to
;; answer for an artifact it did not analyze.

;; which is what a NIC driver needs. It is a RESERVATION in the image's text
;; segment -- one fixed-size entry per vector, whether or not a body exists --
;; so widening it costs bytes in every kernel image that has any entry at all.

  RAX IS DISCARDED. The body returns an i64 and this sequence pops over it.
  Acting on it would mean the entry deciding something -- 'bit 0 means the
  interrupt was acknowledged' is a protocol, and a protocol is a judgement.
  The body acknowledges its own controller with `kernel-out-u8`, where the
  decision is visible in Kotoba and the compiler can see the effect. A return
  value is still useful to a caller that invokes the body directly (a test, or
  the object route's C caller through a non-interrupt path); it is simply not
  something this sequence reads.

  ALIGNMENT. In 64-bit mode the CPU aligns RSP to 16 before pushing the frame
  (Intel SDM Vol 3A 6.14.2), so RSP is 8 mod 16 after a five-word frame and 0
  mod 16 after a six-word one. The synthetic error-code push makes both 0; the
  fifteen GPR pushes make both 8; the fuel push makes both 0 -- which is what
  SysV requires immediately before a `call`. There is deliberately no
  `sub rsp,8` here: the object wrapper needs one because it pushes nothing,
  and adding one here would MIS-align by eight."

;; The slots are now a BLOCK AT A FIXED OFFSET INTO THE CONTEXT PAGE, and the
;; packagers reserve it (`kotoba.native.elf64`, both twins). Two different
;; derivations reach the same block, and the difference is who may trust r9:
;;
;;   configurators   run INLINE in compiled Kotoba, where r9 IS the context
;;                   (the boot shim, the syscall shim and every interrupt
;;                   entry establish it). They address `[r9+slot]`.
;;   handlers        are entered by the CPU from whatever was running. r9 is
;;                   NOT inherited -- `entry-bytes` above says why, and the
;;                   timer can arrive while CPL3 code holds r9 -- so a handler
;;                   that wrote `[r9+slot]` would let user code choose where a
;;                   supervisor store lands. They derive the context from
;;                   `sgdt` instead: the boot shim's `lgdt` names the GDT the
;;                   packager lays down at `context-gdt-offset`, so
;;                   GDTR.base - context-gdt-offset is the context. That is
;;                   CHECKED before it is used: the context's own GDTR copy at
;;                   `context-gdtr-offset` must name this GDT, or the handler
;;                   takes its fail-closed path. A kernel that loads its own
;;                   GDT elsewhere (`kernel-load-gdt-tss`) therefore gets an
;;                   'F' receipt and a halt on the first canned handler, not a
;;                   write to GDT-0x60+slot.
;;
;; The block sits in the gap the packager's layout already had: above the
;; interrupt entry base at 0x148 and below the request area at 0x200.

;; `install-page-fault-idt` puts on vector 14. Three probes exist to be caught
;; by it: a write to the guard page (`kernel-probe-guard-write`), a write to
;; the first text page (`kernel-probe-text-write`) and an instruction fetch
;; from the data page (`kernel-probe-nx-execute`). It names which one fired --
;; 'G' / 'W' / 'X' on the debug port, 0x19 / 0x1a / 0x1b on isa-debug-exit --
;; and ends in `fatal-tail` (reset, then halt only if refused); anything else
;; is 'F' / 0x1f. It never returns, so the CPU frame is read for evidence only
;; and no register is preserved.
;;
;; Until 2026-09-07 its third test was `cmp r10,0x110000` and the probe that
;; provokes it was `movabs r10,0x110000; call r10`: both assumed the RW
;; context page at image-base+0x10000, the same assumption the slot block
;; above carried until #153 (cr3-h1). The JVM packager places that page at the
;; first page past the text, and in the aiueos kernel 0x110000 is INSIDE RX
;; text -- so the probe would have executed text, and the classifier could
;; never say 'X' for a fetch from the page it was written to name. Both now
;; DERIVE the page. The probe calls r9: the context register IS the page, and
;; the probe runs inline in compiled Kotoba where r9 is established. The
;; classifier is entered by the CPU, so it finds the context from the GDTR the
;; way the three handlers above do, and takes the same fail-closed path when
;; the GDTR does not name the packager's GDT.
;;
;; 0x100000 and 0x101000 stay literal. They are the two addresses the packager
;; PINS (`kotoba.native.elf64/pinned-image-addresses`): the ELF header page it
;; leaves unmapped as the guard, and the first text page. Neither moves when
;; the text grows -- the property the data page lacked.

;;
;; Vector 6 is the trap THIS COMPILER emits. Every bounded load and store ends
;; its range check in `ud2`, and so does every fuel charge: a kernel whose
;; per-boot budget runs out executes `ud2` in the next prologue. Until
;; 2026-09-07 a kernel that installed no vector 6 gate went silent there --
;; an empty gate is #GP, an empty #GP gate is #DF, an empty #DF gate is a
;; triple fault and a reset. Measured twice on real hardware (aiueos k16
;; rank-02, amu-h7): the only evidence was a missing run-end byte.
;;
;; This is the canned answer: 'U' on the debug port, 0x1d on isa-debug-exit,
;; then `fatal-tail` -- reset the platform, and halt only if the chipset
;; refused (the k16 board sat halted for nine hours on 2026-09-08 when this
;; ended in `hlt`). Terminal, like the classifier -- #UD is a fault, the saved
;; RIP is the `ud2` itself, and advancing it would mean deciding how long the
;; faulting instruction was. It contains no decision and needs no context, so
;; it does not derive one: the letter IS the vector's name.
;;
;; 'U' because it is unused. The aiueos kernel writes E M P R C D N F, the
;; classifier G W X F, the recovery handler R, the double-fault handler D, and
;; the ISR fixture I S R P. 0x1d is the next free isa-debug-exit code after the
;; double-fault handler's 0x1c; 0x1f is 'F'.
;;
;; It is reached through the entry region: an image that lays one (any
;; `aiueos-isr-N` body) and declares no body for vector 6 gets this in the
;; vector-6 slot (`absent-entry-bytes-for` below), so a gate built from
;; `kernel-isr-entry-address 6` names it rather than a silent halt. A kernel
;; that lays no region -- the aiueos kernel today installs only vector 14 from
;; `kernel-page-fault-handler-address` -- reaches it through
;; `kernel-undefined-opcode-handler-address` instead: both lowering arms in
;; `kotoba.native.x86-64` and `kotoba.native.machine-ir` embed THESE bytes and
;; answer with their address, the way the three canned handler addresses do,
;; so either route installs one handler. The operation pilots only once
;; kotoba-gmir's `x86-privileged-action-arities`, kotoba-kir, kotoba-sema and
;; `guest-grammar.edn` admit it as well (five repositories; this one last).
